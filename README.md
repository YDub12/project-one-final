# The Battle of Cannae
In this project I set out to give a brief overview of the Battle of Cannae, part of the Second Punic War, a brief synopsis involving the beginning of the war and a look at the tactics involved as a well as a brief section looking at the aftermath. 

The site is targeted towards people, who may not be aware of one of the most significant incidents in Western European history. It gives some information and includes some of the artwork relating to the time period.
