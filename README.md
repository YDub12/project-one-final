# The Battle of Cannae

[View the live site here](https://ydub12.github.io/project-one-final/)

In this project I set out to give a brief overview of the Battle of Cannae, part of the Second Punic War, a brief synopsis involving the beginning of the war and a look at the tactics involved as a well as a brief section looking at the aftermath. 

The site is targeted towards people, who may not be aware of one of the most significant incidents in Western European history. It gives some information and includes some of the artwork relating to the time period.

## Features
- __Navigation Bar__
    - Featured across the website with different sizes incorporated
    ![header](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YDub12/project-one-final/main/assets/images/header.PNG)
    
- __Video content__
    - Included on one of the pages with autoplay disabled

- __Prelude page__
    - Built to provide information on the background of the war itself, it includes the aforementioned video content as well as an image to provide context for the route

- __Navigation buttons__
    - To save people needing to scroll back and forth to the top and save space on smaller screens 

- __Variety of images__
    - Used sparingly, to break up long stretches of text

### Features left to implement
- __Styling the Form Page__
    - I unfortunately ran out of time to properly style the form page and would like to rework it to be more in keeping with some of the sample projects.

## Testing
All external links were checked to make sure they opened in a new tab, including embedded Wikipedia links. 

After deployment it has been sent to other devices and opened, including phone, laptop and larger desktop screens. 

### Bugs
There were numerous bugs throughout, the navigation buttons would often position themselves in awkward places and the padding on smaller screens lead to there being overlap throughout. This was initially resolved with placing them in their own section and reducing the padding on the sides.

There were issues with the image placements which interrupted the flow of information. This was resolved by placing them in a flex display.

After deploying to Github, I found I had incorrect pathways to my css and all of my images failed to display as well all of my styling. This was a nice reminder on relative filepaths and early deployment.

### Validator Testing
CSS - No errors were found when passing through the [official validator Jigsaw](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator) 

HTML - All HTML also passed through the [official validator](https://validator.w3.org/)


## Deployment
- The site was deployed to GitHub pages.
- I used the method shown in the love running project

[That was found on a post from 2017 on my country Europe](https://mycountryeurope.com/history/hannibal-battle-cannae/)

I also used [Google Earth](https://earth.google.com/web/) to get the actual site of Cannae 

The bust of Hannibal is from a dig in Capua and was downloaded from Wikipedia

Finally the route of Hannibal's march was taken from a Reddit post on [r/phoenicianhistoryfacts](https://www.reddit.com/r/PhoeniciaHistoryFacts/comments/12jyk8x/map_of_hannibals_march_white_line_the_dotted_line/#lightbox)

Images for the footer were taken from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/search?q=wiki&o=r&m=free) 

### Content 
All written Content was written by myself, but using Wikipedia articles to refresh my memory. 

The basic styling and syntax of header, footer and main were all initially taken from the Love Running project and some css styling for generic styles. The footer basically being lifted from the Love Running project. 

I used ChatGPT for some basic styling points around the header, but adapted it through the testing period.
