                On the 2nd of August 216 BC Western Europe saw one of the greatest battles, 
                the largest army the Roman Republic ever assembled 86,400 men, 80,000 infantry and 6,400 cavalry, 
                faced off against 50,000 Carthaginian troops. The Carthaginians brought with them men from; Gaul, Hispania, Libya and the superb Numidian cavalry. 
                Clashing on a plain with the Aufidus river on one side, the two consuls, Gaius Terentius Varro and Lucius Aemilius Paullus brought Hannibal to battle.
                The two consuls were diametrically opposed. Varro, a plebeian and son of a butcher, 
                was the more aggressive, Paullus the patrician, was a disciple of Fabian, the Roman dictator 
                who advocated for avoiding direct conflict with Hannibal. The split command style meant that the two consuls would alternate the overall leadership of the army daily.

                Hannibal at this stage of the war had built his reputation as a master of using the terrain available. He had scored two substantial victories in the preceding two years at Trebia and Trasimene 
                and had created such a panic in Rome, that they had called upon Fabian, mentioned above, to take on emergency powers. Now with a new year approaching and a new army the Romans felt very confident. 
                We will take a look at how the war itself came about, the battle itself and its aftermath as we explore the greatest loss of life in a single day in Western Europe until the Battle of the Somme.
