            <h2>Join us as we delve into the bloodiest day in the Ancient World</h2>
            <p>
                On the 2nd of August 216 BC a Roman army the likes of which had never been seen, took to the field 
                to face off against the existential threat of the Republic's greatest enemy, Hannibal Barca. 
            </p>
            <p>
                After his audacious march from Southern Spain through the Alps to surprise two Roman armies, one at Trebia and the other
                at Trasimene. Hannibal had shown he was a master of using the terrain to his advantage. This time the Romans caught him on an open field believing themselves to be infallible, 
                they advanced into the jaws of a trap.  
            </p>
            <p>
                We will take a look at how the war itself came about, the battle itself and its aftermath as we explore the greatest loss of life in a single day in Western Europe until the Battle of the Somme.
